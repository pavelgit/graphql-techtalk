	Open the slides
	Run the app


1. Introduction. 
	I've prepared a short review of GraphQL
	Will talk about key features
	Show a sample app 
	Show how it could be integrated in our project
	Let's go


2. Simple definition of GraphQL
	it is query language
	to be used on client-server applications, on client side
	to fetch data from the server
	it's developed by Facebook in order make life easier
	don't know what it has with graphs...	


3. Examples "social network"
	SLIDE "First example" - Explain all the parts of the query
	SLIDE "User" - response cintains what we've asked for
	SLIDE "User with friend ids"- still a usual thing
	SLIDE "User with friends data" - that's a thing!


4. How does it work
	We have schema - all the types and fields (graphql is strongly-typed). And "resolve" methods.
	Server - serves the requests, uses schema and data
	Client - makes requests, and gets exactly what it needs

	Any transport - http or whatever
	Any client, server - implementations (nodejs, java, ...)
	Any response-format - json, xml, whatever...
	Any data storage


5.	SLIDES - "How graphql works"


6. Now I will describe the key features of GraphQL
	SLIDES - "Features"


7. Let's compare to rest:

	SLIDE "GraphQL vs REST". 
	Now mainly rest is used

	SLIDE "GraphQL vs REST approach"
	SLIDES "Comparison"


8. The sample app

	is a social network
	user list
	user page - data, follows
	user feed - what he reads

	Backend
	- data.json - users, follows, contacts, messages
	- user address type, user contacts type
	- user type, message type
	- query
	- schema
	- index.js



9. Who uses it??
