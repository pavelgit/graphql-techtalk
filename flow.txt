	node server.js


1. Introduction. 
	I've prepared a short review of GraphQL
	Will tell about key features, compare
	Show a sample app
	Let's go


2. What is GraphQL?
	- query language
	- client-server
	- fetch data
	- developed by Facebook
	don't know what it has with graphs...	


3. Examples "social network"
	SLIDE "First example" - Explain all the parts of the query
	SLIDE "User" - response cintains what we've asked for
	SLIDE "User with friend ids"- still a usual thing
	SLIDE "User with friends data" - that's a thing!


4. Explain parts
	- Client
	- Server with single graphql endpoint
	- Schema - data structure : types + "Resolve" functions

	SLIDE - Schema

	Any transport - http or whatever
	Any client, server - implementations (nodejs, java, ...)
	Any response-format - json, xml, whatever...
	Any data storage


5.	SLIDES - "How graphql works"
	A few words about mutations


6. Now I will describe the key features of GraphQL
	SLIDES - "Features"
	...introspective


7. SLIDE "GraphQL vs REST". 
	traditionally rest is used

	SLIDE "GraphQL vs REST approach"
	SLIDES "Comparison"


8. The sample app - messenger, where people write and read short messages

	is a "messenging social network"
	has user list
	has user page - data, follows
	has user feed - what he reads

	Backend
	- data.json - users, follows, contacts, messages
	- data service
	
	- schema
	- message type
	- user type (address, contacts)
	- query
	- index.js

	Graphiql

	Frontend
	- backend-api.service
	- user list page
	- user page
	- feed page

	show: feed page, add author
